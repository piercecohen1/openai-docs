# Responses Overview

OpenAI's most advanced interface for generating model responses. Supports
text and image inputs, and text outputs. Create stateful interactions
with the model, using the output of previous responses as input. Extend
the model's capabilities with built-in tools for file search, web search,
computer use, and more. Allow the model access to external systems and data
using function calling.
