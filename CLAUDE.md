# OpenAI API Docs Mirror

Local mirror of OpenAI API documentation from developers.openai.com, stored as raw markdown. Two sections:

- `reference/` — API reference (endpoint schemas, request/response formats, method signatures)
- `guides/` — Conceptual docs, tutorials, and how-to guides

See `README.md` for scrape date, page counts, and directory tree.

## How It Works

- Two `llms.txt` indexes: `/api/reference/llms.txt` (225 pages) and `/api/docs/llms.txt` (122 pages)
- `download.sh` fetches both indexes, extracts URLs, downloads all pages preserving nested directory structure
- Also downloads `llms-full.txt` for each section — single-file concatenations for full-text search
- The README is auto-generated by `download.sh` with scrape metadata, section counts, and directory tree

## Re-scraping

```bash
bash download.sh --force   # Clear cached URL lists, re-fetch from llms.txt
git add -A && git commit -m "Update docs mirror $(date +%-m-%-d-%y)" && git push
```

## Searching

```bash
rg "query" reference/                  # API reference
rg "query" guides/                     # Guides
rg "query" reference/llms-full.txt     # Full-text reference
rg "query" guides/llms-full.txt        # Full-text guides
```
