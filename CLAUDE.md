# OpenAI API Docs Mirror

Local mirror of OpenAI API reference documentation from developers.openai.com, stored as raw markdown under `docs/`. See `README.md` for scrape date, page counts, and directory tree.

## How It Works

- Docs site publishes an index at `https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/llms.txt` with direct `.md` URLs
- `download.sh` fetches this index, extracts URLs, and downloads all pages preserving nested directory structure
- Also downloads `llms-full.txt` — a single-file concatenation of all API reference docs (~2364 lines)
- The README is auto-generated by `download.sh` with scrape metadata, section counts, and directory tree

## Re-scraping

```bash
bash download.sh --force   # Clear cached URL list, re-fetch from llms.txt
git add -A && git commit -m "Update docs mirror $(date +%-m-%-d-%y)" && git push
```

## Searching

```bash
rg "query" docs/
rg "chat" docs/resources/
rg "function calling" docs/llms-full.txt
```
