# Skills

Agent Skills let you upload and reuse versioned bundles of files in hosted and local shell environments.

We support Skills in two form factors: local execution and hosted,
  container-based execution. To run code on your own machine, use the local
  execution mode of the [shell tool](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-shell).

## What's a skill

A skill is a versioned bundle of files plus a `SKILL.md` manifest (front matter + instructions). Skills are modular instructions you can use to codify processes and conventions, from company style guides to multi-step workflows.

Skills are compatible with the open [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/home).

## Create a skill

You can upload a directory as multipart form data or upload a `.zip` that contains a single top-level folder.

### Option 1: Directory upload (multipart)

Upload multiple `files[]` parts. Each part includes the path inside a single top-level folder.

### Option 2: Zip upload

Zip the top-level folder and upload the zip file.

## Use skills with hosted shell

To mount skills in a hosted shell environment, attach them via `tools[].environment.skills` when calling the shell tool.

Use skills in hosted shell

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5.2",
  tools: [
    {
      type: "shell",
      environment: {
        type: "container_auto",
        skills: [
          { type: "skill_reference", skill_id: "<skill_id>" },
          { type: "skill_reference", skill_id: "<skill_id>", version: 2 },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
  input: "Use the skills to add 144 and 377, then compute triangle area with base 9 height 13.",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5.2",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "shell",
            "environment": {
                "type": "container_auto",
                "skills": [
                    {"type": "skill_reference", "skill_id": "<skill_id>"},
                    {"type": "skill_reference", "skill_id": "<skill_id>", "version": 2},
                ],
            },
        }
    ],
    input="Use the skills to add 144 and 377, then compute triangle area with base 9 height 13.",
)

print(response.output_text)
```


### Prompting behavior

Once a skill is mounted, the model can decide when to use it. If you want more deterministic behavior, explicitly instruct the model to "use the `<skill name>` skill" when appropriate.

## Use skills with local shell mode

Skills also work with local shell mode. The skill selection and prompt behavior are the same as hosted shell mode, but command execution and filesystem access are still handled by your local runtime.

Use the [Shell guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-shell) for local shell execution details.

Use skills in local shell mode

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5.2",
  tools: [
    {
      type: "shell",
      environment: {
        type: "local",
        skills: [
          { type: "skill_reference", skill_id: "<skill_id>" },
          { type: "skill_reference", skill_id: "<skill_id>", version: 2 },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
  input: "Use the configured skills and run locally to summarize today's CSV reports in this repo.",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5.2",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "shell",
            "environment": {
                "type": "local",
                "skills": [
                    {"type": "skill_reference", "skill_id": "<skill_id>"},
                    {"type": "skill_reference", "skill_id": "<skill_id>", "version": 2},
                ],
            },
        }
    ],
    input="Use the configured skills and run locally to summarize today's CSV reports in this repo.",
)

print(response.output_text)
```


## Skills in the user prompt

When skills are available to the tool, the platform adds each skill's `name`, `description`, and `path` to user prompt context so the model knows the skill exists.

The model decides whether to invoke a skill based on this metadata. If the model invokes a skill, it uses the `path` to read the full Markdown instructions from `SKILL.md`.

Skill instructions are user prompt input (not system prompt input), so they're handled with the same priority as other user-provided instructions. For explicit control, you can still instruct the model to "use the `<skill name>` skill."

## Limits and validation

- `SKILL.md` file matching is case-insensitive.
- Exactly one `skill.md`/`SKILL.md` file is allowed in a skill bundle.
- Skill front matter validation follows the [agent skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification#name-field).
- Maximum zip upload size is `50 MB`.
- Maximum file count per skill version is `500`.
- Maximum uncompressed file size is `25 MB`.

## Safety with network access

It is very important to inspect any Skill used with the Responses API. Skills
  introduce security risks such as prompt injection-driven data exfiltration.
  Carefully review the [Risks and safety](#risks-and-safety) section below
  before using this tool.

## Versioning and management

### Version pointers

- `default_version` is used when a version isn't provided.
- `latest_version` tracks the newest upload.
- `skill_reference.version` accepts an integer or `"latest"`.

### Create a new version

### Set default version

### Delete rules

- You can't delete the default version; set another default first.
- Deleting the last remaining version deletes the skill.
- Deleting a skill cascades to remove all versions.

## Curated skills

OpenAI maintains a set of first-party skills that can be referenced by id (for example, `openai-spreadsheets`).

## Inline skills

If you don't want to create a hosted skill, you can inline a zip bundle (base64) in the environment's `skills` array.

## Risks and safety

It's important to inspect any Skill used with the Responses API. Skills introduce security risks such as prompt injection-driven data exfiltration.

For Skills used in conjunction with network access, carefully review the [Risks and safety section for networking](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-shell#risks-and-safety).

#### Treat Skills as privileged code and instructions

Skill content can influence planning, tool usage, and command execution. Any Skill should be reviewed as potentially untrusted input until validated by the developer.

### Don't expose an open Skills repository to end-users

Avoid product designs where consumer end-users can freely browse, select, or attach arbitrary Skills from an open catalog. This materially increases risk from:

- Prompt-injection and policy bypass via malicious SKILL.md instructions.
- Data exfiltration or destructive actions triggered by unvetted automation.

#### Integrate Skills at the developer level

Skills should be inspected and integrated by the developer, then exposed to end-users only through bounded product experiences. In practice:

- Map Skills to specific product workflows/use cases.
- Prevent end-user control over arbitrary Skill selection.
- Gate write or high-impact actions behind explicit approval and policy checks.

#### Require approval for sensitive actions

For workflows that can perform write or high-impact actions, require explicit approval before execution.

#### Validate data residency and retention requirements

We support Skills in two form factors: local execution and hosted container-based execution. Skills running in OpenAI hosted containers can't be used when Zero Data Retention is enabled. Read more about our [data controls](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/your-data).
