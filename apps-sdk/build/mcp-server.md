# Build your MCP server

By the end of this guide, you’ll know how to connect your backend MCP server to ChatGPT, define tools, register UI templates, and tie everything together using the widget runtime. You’ll build a working foundation for a ChatGPT App that returns structured data, renders an interactive widget, and keeps your model, server, and UI in sync. If you prefer to dive straight into the implementation, you can skip ahead to the [example](#example) at the end.

Build faster with the [OpenAI Docs MCP server](https://developers.openai.com/learn/docs-mcp) in your
  editor.

## Overview

### What an MCP server does for your app

ChatGPT Apps have three components:

- **Your MCP server** defines tools, provides optional server instructions, enforces auth, returns data, and points each tool to a UI bundle.
- **The widget/UI bundle** renders inside ChatGPT’s iframe and communicates with the host through the MCP Apps UI bridge (JSON-RPC over `postMessage`).
- **The model** decides when to call tools and narrates the experience using the structured data you return.

A solid server implementation keeps those boundaries clean so you can iterate on UI and data independently. Remember: you build the MCP server and define the tools, but ChatGPT’s model chooses when to call them based on the metadata you provide.

### Before you begin

Prerequisites:

- Comfortable with TypeScript or Python and a web bundler (Vite, esbuild, etc.).
- MCP server reachable over HTTP (local is fine to start).
- Built UI bundle that exports a root script (React or vanilla).

Example project layout:

```
your-chatgpt-app/
├─ server/
│  └─ src/index.ts          # MCP server + tool handlers
├─ web/
│  ├─ src/component.tsx     # React widget
│  └─ dist/app.{js,css}  # Bundled assets referenced by the server
└─ package.json
```

## Architecture flow

1. A user prompt causes ChatGPT to call one of your MCP tools.
2. Your server runs the handler, fetches authoritative data, and returns `structuredContent`, `_meta`, and UI metadata.
3. ChatGPT loads the HTML template linked in the tool descriptor (served as `text/html;profile=mcp-app`) and delivers tool inputs/results to the iframe over the MCP Apps bridge (for example, `ui/notifications/tool-result`).
4. The widget renders from tool results, can call tools again with `tools/call`, and can optionally use ChatGPT-only extensions when needed.
5. The model reads `structuredContent` to narrate what happened, so keep it tight and idempotent—ChatGPT may retry tool calls.

```
User prompt
   ↓
ChatGPT model ──► MCP tool call ──► Your server ──► Tool response (`structuredContent`, `_meta`, `content`)
   │                                                   │
   └───── renders narration ◄──── widget iframe ◄──────┘
                              (HTML template + MCP Apps bridge)
```

## Use the MCP Apps UI bridge

ChatGPT supports the open MCP Apps standard for UI communication:

- JSON-RPC 2.0 messages over `postMessage`.
- `ui/*` methods and notifications for host↔iframe UI communication.
- MCP tool calls through `tools/call`.

Start with the MCP Apps bridge to keep your UI portable across hosts, then add
ChatGPT extensions when you need ChatGPT-specific capabilities. For a deeper
walkthrough and a mapping guide, see
[MCP Apps compatibility in ChatGPT](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/mcp-apps-in-chatgpt).

## Understand the `window.openai` widget runtime

`window.openai` is an Apps SDK compatibility layer and a home for optional
ChatGPT extensions. For new apps, use the MCP Apps bridge by default and treat
`window.openai` as an API for additional capabilities unique to ChatGPT.

Unique capabilities include:

- **File handling (ChatGPT extension):** `uploadFile`, `selectFiles`, and `getFileDownloadUrl` cover file uploads, selection, and downloads.
- **Host surfaces (ChatGPT extension):** `requestModal` opens a host-owned modal.
- **Commerce (ChatGPT extension):** `requestCheckout` opens Instant Checkout (when enabled).

For the full `window.openai` reference, see the [ChatGPT UI guide](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/build/chatgpt-ui#understand-the-windowopenai-api).

Use `requestModal` when you need a host-controlled overlay—for example, open a checkout or detail view anchored to an “Add to cart” button so shoppers can review options without forcing the inline widget to resize. To show a different UI template in the modal, pass the template URI you registered (for example, via `registerAppResource`).

Use these APIs when they materially improve your ChatGPT experience, but keep
your core UI bridge built on the MCP Apps standard. For implementation patterns, see
[Build your ChatGPT UI](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/build/chatgpt-ui).

## Pick an SDK

Apps SDK works with any MCP implementation, but the official SDKs are the quickest way to get started. They ship tool/schema helpers, HTTP server scaffolding, resource registration utilities, and end-to-end type safety so you can stay focused on business logic:

- **Python SDK** – Iterate quickly with FastMCP or FastAPI. Repo: [`modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).
- **TypeScript SDK** – Ideal when your stack is already Node/React. Repo: [`modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk), published as `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Docs live on [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

Install whichever SDK matches your backend language, then follow the steps below.

```bash
# TypeScript / Node
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk @modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps zod

# Python
pip install mcp
```

## Build your MCP server

### Add server instructions for cross-tool guidance

MCP servers can return an [`instructions` field](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle#initialization) during initialization. ChatGPT and Codex use these instructions alongside your tool metadata when deciding how to work with your server.

Use server instructions for guidance that applies across tools, such as required tool sequences, shared rate limits, or relationships between tools. Keep the guidance concise and put the most important details first; for ChatGPT and Codex, the first 512 characters should be self-contained. Don't use server instructions to repeat every tool description or change the model's personality.

```ts


const server = new McpServer(
  { name: "kanban-server", version: "1.0.0" },
  {
    instructions:
      "Before updating a task, call list_tasks to validate the task ID. For bulk edits, process at most 10 tasks per request.",
  }
);
```

### Step 1 – Register a component template

Each UI bundle is exposed as an MCP resource with the MCP Apps UI MIME type (`text/html;profile=mcp-app`). If you use `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/server`, prefer `RESOURCE_MIME_TYPE` instead of hardcoding the string.

Register the template and include metadata for borders, domains, and CSP rules:

```ts
// Registers the Kanban widget HTML entry point served to ChatGPT.




const server = new McpServer({ name: "kanban-server", version: "1.0.0" });
const HTML = readFileSync("web/dist/kanban.js", "utf8");
const CSS = readFileSync("web/dist/kanban.css", "utf8");

registerAppResource(
  server,
  "kanban-widget",
  "ui://widget/kanban-board.html",
  {},
  async () => ({
    contents: [
      {
        uri: "ui://widget/kanban-board.html",
        mimeType: RESOURCE_MIME_TYPE,
        text: `
<div id="kanban-root"></div>
<style>${CSS}</style>
<script type="module">${HTML}</script>
        `.trim(),
        _meta: {
          ui: {
            prefersBorder: true,
            domain: "https://myapp.example.com",
            csp: {
              connectDomains: ["https://api.myapp.example.com"], // example API domain
              resourceDomains: ["https://*.oaistatic.com"], // example CDN allowlist
              // Optional: allow embedding specific iframe origins.
              frameDomains: ["https://*.example-embed.com"],
            },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  })
);
```

If you need to embed iframes inside your widget, use `_meta.ui.csp.frameDomains` to declare an allowlist of origins. Without `frameDomains` set, subframes are blocked by default. Because iframe content is harder for us to inspect, widgets that enable subframes are reviewed with extra scrutiny and may not be approved for directory distribution.

**Best practice:** When you change your widget’s HTML/JS/CSS in a breaking way, give the template a new URI (or use a new file name) so ChatGPT always loads the updated bundle instead of a cached one.

Treat the URI as your cache key. When you update the markup or bundle, version
the URI and update every reference to it (for example, the `registerAppResource`
URI, `_meta.ui.resourceUri` in your tool descriptor, and the `contents[].uri`
in your template list). ChatGPT honors `_meta["openai/outputTemplate"]`
as an OpenAI-specific compatibility alias.

```ts
// Old
contents: [{ uri: "ui://widget/kanban-board.html" /* ... */ }];
// New
contents: [{ uri: "ui://widget/kanban-board-v2.html" /* ... */ }];
```

If you ship updates frequently, keep a short, consistent versioning scheme so you can roll forward (or back) without reusing the same URI.

### Step 2 – Describe tools

Tools are the contract the model reasons about. Define one tool per user intent (e.g., `list_tasks`, `update_task`). Each descriptor should include:

- Machine-readable name and human-readable title.
- Schema for arguments. With the Node helper shown below, use Zod raw shapes or
  Standard Schema; other SDKs may expose JSON Schema or dataclasses.
- Schema for returned `structuredContent` (`outputSchema`) so clients and
  models know the shape of the tool result.
- `_meta.ui.resourceUri` pointing to the template URI.
- Optional `_meta.ui.visibility` to control whether the tool is callable by the model, the UI, or both.
- Optional ChatGPT extensions (like short status text while a tool runs).

_The model inspects these descriptors to decide when a tool fits the user’s request, so treat names, descriptions, and schemas as part of your UX._

Design handlers to be **idempotent**—the model may retry calls.

```ts
// Example app that exposes a kanban-board tool with schema, metadata, and handler.



registerAppTool(
  server,
  "kanban-board",
  {
    title: "Show Kanban Board",
    inputSchema: { workspace: z.string() },
    outputSchema: {
      columns: z.array(
        z.object({
          id: z.string(),
          title: z.string(),
          tasks: z.array(
            z.object({
              id: z.string(),
              title: z.string(),
              status: z.string(),
            })
          ),
        })
      ),
    },
    _meta: {
      ui: { resourceUri: "ui://widget/kanban-board.html" },
      // ChatGPT extension (optional):
      // "openai/toolInvocation/invoking": "Preparing the board…",
      // "openai/toolInvocation/invoked": "Board ready.",
    },
  },
  async ({ workspace }) => {
    const board = await loadBoard(workspace);
    return {
      structuredContent: board.summary,
      content: [{ type: "text", text: `Showing board ${workspace}` }],
      _meta: board.details,
    };
  }
);
```

#### Memory and tool calls

Memory is user-controlled and model-mediated: the model decides if and how to use it when selecting or parameterizing a tool call. By default, memories are turned off with apps. Users can enable or disable memory for an app. Apps do not receive a separate memory feed; they only see whatever the model includes in tool inputs. When memory is off, a request is re-evaluated without memory in the model context.

<img src="https://developers.openai.com/images/apps-sdk/memories.png"
  alt="Memory settings in ChatGPT"
  class="w-full max-w-xl mx-auto rounded-lg"
/>

**Best practices**

- Keep tool inputs explicit and required for correctness; do not rely on memory for critical fields.
- Treat memory as a hint, not authority; confirm user preferences when it is important to your user flow and may have side effects.
- Provide safe defaults or ask a follow-up question when context is missing.
- Make tools resilient to retries, re-evaluation, or missing memories.
- For write or destructive actions, re-confirm intent and key parameters in the current turn.

### Step 3 – Return structured data and metadata

Every tool response can include three sibling payloads:

- **`structuredContent`** – concise JSON the widget uses _and_ the model reads. Include only what the model should see.
- **`content`** – optional narration (Markdown or plaintext) for the model’s response.
- **`_meta`** – large or sensitive data exclusively for the widget. `_meta` never reaches the model.

```ts
// Returns concise structuredContent for the model plus rich _meta for the widget.
async function loadKanbanBoard(workspace: string) {
  const tasks = await db.fetchTasks(workspace);
  return {
    structuredContent: {
      columns: ["todo", "in-progress", "done"].map((status) => ({
        id: status,
        title: status.replace("-", " "),
        tasks: tasks.filter((task) => task.status === status).slice(0, 5),
      })),
    },
    content: [
      {
        type: "text",
        text: "Here's the latest snapshot. Drag cards in the widget to update status.",
      },
    ],
    _meta: {
      tasksById: Object.fromEntries(tasks.map((task) => [task.id, task])),
      lastSyncedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    },
  };
}
```

The widget receives those payloads over the MCP Apps bridge (for example,
`ui/notifications/tool-result`), while the model only sees `structuredContent`
and `content`.

### Step 4 – Run locally

1. Build your UI bundle (`npm run build` inside `web/`).
2. Start the MCP server (Node, Python, etc.).
3. Use [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) early and often to call `http://localhost:<port>/mcp`, list roots, and verify your widget renders correctly. Inspector mirrors ChatGPT’s widget runtime and catches issues before deployment.

For a TypeScript project, that usually looks like:

```bash
npm run build       # compile server + widget
node dist/index.js  # start the compiled MCP server
```

### Step 5 – Expose an HTTPS endpoint

ChatGPT requires HTTPS. During development, tunnel localhost with ngrok (or similar):

```bash
ngrok http <port>
# Forwarding: https://<subdomain>.ngrok.app -> http://127.0.0.1:<port>
```

Use the ngrok URL when creating a connector in ChatGPT developer mode. For production, deploy to a low-latency HTTPS host (Cloudflare Workers, Fly.io, Vercel, AWS, etc.).

## Example

Here’s a stripped-down TypeScript server plus vanilla widget. For full projects, reference the public [Apps SDK examples](https://github.com/openai/openai-apps-sdk-examples).

```ts
// server/src/index.ts




const server = new McpServer({ name: "hello-world", version: "1.0.0" });

registerAppResource(
  server,
  "hello",
  "ui://widget/hello.html",
  {},
  async () => ({
    contents: [
      {
        uri: "ui://widget/hello.html",
        mimeType: RESOURCE_MIME_TYPE,
        text: `
<div id="root"></div>
<script type="module" src="https://example.com/hello-widget.js"></script>
      `.trim(),
      },
    ],
  })
);

registerAppTool(
  server,
  "hello_widget",
  {
    title: "Show hello widget",
    inputSchema: { name: z.string() },
    outputSchema: { message: z.string() },
    _meta: { ui: { resourceUri: "ui://widget/hello.html" } },
  },
  async ({ name }) => ({
    structuredContent: { message: `Hello ${name}!` },
    content: [{ type: "text", text: `Greeting ${name}` }],
    _meta: {},
  })
);
```

```js
// hello-widget.js
const root = document.getElementById("root");
root.textContent = "Loading…";

const update = (toolResult) => {
  const message = toolResult?.structuredContent?.message ?? "Hi!";
  root.textContent = message;
};

window.addEventListener(
  "message",
  (event) => {
    if (event.source !== window.parent) return;
    const message = event.data;
    if (!message || message.jsonrpc !== "2.0") return;
    if (message.method !== "ui/notifications/tool-result") return;
    update(message.params);
  },
  { passive: true }
);
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Widget doesn’t render** – Ensure the template resource returns `mimeType: "text/html;profile=mcp-app"` and that the bundled JS/CSS URLs resolve inside the sandbox.
- **No `ui/*` messages arrive** – The host only enables the MCP Apps bridge for `text/html;profile=mcp-app` resources; double-check the MIME type and that the widget loaded without CSP violations.
- **CSP or CORS failures** – Use `_meta.ui.csp` to allow the exact domains you fetch from; the sandbox blocks everything else.
- **Stale bundles keep loading** – Cache-bust template URIs or file names whenever you deploy breaking changes.
- **Structured payloads are huge** – Trim `structuredContent` to what the model truly needs; oversized payloads degrade model performance and slow rendering.

## Advanced capabilities

### Component-initiated tool calls

Use `tools/call` to invoke tools directly from your UI. By default, tools are
available to both the model and the UI. Use `_meta.ui.visibility` to restrict
where a tool is available.

```json
"_meta": {
  "ui": {
    "resourceUri": "ui://widget/kanban-board.html",
    "visibility": ["model", "app"]
  }
}
```

#### Tool visibility

To make a tool callable from your UI but hidden from the model, set
`_meta.ui.visibility` to `["app"]`. This keeps the tool available to the widget
via `tools/call` without influencing tool selection by the model.

```json
"_meta": {
  "ui": {
    "resourceUri": "ui://widget/kanban-board.html",
    "visibility": ["app"]
  }
}
```

### Tool annotations and elicitation

MCP tools must include [`tool annotations`](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/legacy/concepts/tools#tool-annotations) that describe the tool’s _potential impact_. These hints are required for tool definitions.

The three hints we look at are:

- `readOnlyHint`: Set to `true` for tools that only retrieve or compute information and do not create, update, delete, or send data outside of ChatGPT (search, lookups, previews).
- `openWorldHint`: Set to `false` for tools that only affect a bounded target (for example, “update a task by id” in your own product). Leave `true` for tools that can write to arbitrary URLs/files/resources.
- `destructiveHint`: Set to `true` for tools that can delete, overwrite, or have irreversible side effects.

`openWorldHint` and `destructiveHint` are only relevant for writes (that is,
when `readOnlyHint=false`).

Set these hints accurately so the tool’s impact is correctly described.

If you omit these hints (or leave them as `null`), treat it as a validation
error and update the tool definition to include them.

Example tool descriptor:

```json
{
  "name": "update_task",
  "title": "Update task",
  "annotations": {
    "readOnlyHint": false,
    "openWorldHint": false,
    "destructiveHint": false
  }
}
```

### File handling

**ChatGPT extension (optional):** If your tool accepts user-provided files,
declare file parameters with `_meta["openai/fileParams"]`. The value is a list
of top-level input schema fields that should be treated as files. Nested file
fields are not supported.

File params describe the input side of file handling: they tell ChatGPT which
tool arguments contain files that the runtime should authorize and pass through
as file references.

Each declared file param receives an object with this shape:

```json
{
  "download_url": "https://...",
  "file_id": "file_...",
  "mime_type": "image/png",
  "file_name": "input.png"
}
```

`download_url` and `file_id` are required. `mime_type` and `file_name` are
optional. The `download_url` is temporary and should be used only while handling
the current tool call. If the file reference came from a widget upload, selected
file, or another tool result, use `file_id` when you need to request a fresh
download URL from ChatGPT.

Example:

```ts



const imageFileSchema = z.object({
  download_url: z.string(),
  file_id: z.string(),
  mime_type: z.string().optional(),
  file_name: z.string().optional(),
});

registerAppTool(
  server,
  "process_image",
  {
    title: "process_image",
    description: "Processes an image",
    inputSchema: {
      imageToProcess: imageFileSchema,
    },
    outputSchema: {
      download_url: z.string(),
      file_id: z.string(),
      mime_type: z.string().optional(),
      file_name: z.string().optional(),
    },
    _meta: {
      ui: { resourceUri: "ui://widget/widget.html" },
      "openai/fileParams": ["imageToProcess"],
    },
  },
  async ({ imageToProcess }) => {
    return {
      content: [],
      structuredContent: {
        download_url: imageToProcess.download_url,
        file_id: imageToProcess.file_id,
        mime_type: imageToProcess.mime_type,
        file_name: imageToProcess.file_name,
      },
    };
  }
);
```

To return downloadable files from a tool, include a file reference in
`structuredContent`, usually under a field such as `file_uri`:

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "file_uri": {
      "download_url": "https://...",
      "file_id": "file_...",
      "mime_type": "application/pdf",
      "file_name": "report.pdf"
    }
  }
}
```

This is the output side of file handling. Your tool should return a file
reference instead of inline binary data or base64 content when the result is a
downloadable file. ChatGPT can use the returned `file_id` to provide the widget
with a fresh temporary download URL.

ChatGPT also supports downloadable files returned as MCP
[`resource_link`](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools#resource-links)
content. Use this for file outputs that should be exposed to the user as
downloads. For direct web downloads, return an
[`https://`](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources#https)
resource URI as defined by MCP. ChatGPT elicits user approval before it
downloads that file for the user.

### Content security policy (CSP)

Set `_meta.ui.csp` on the widget resource so the sandbox knows which domains to
allow for `connect-src`, `img-src`, `frame-src`, etc. This is required before
broad distribution.

```json
"_meta": {
  "ui": {
    "csp": {
      "connectDomains": ["https://api.example.com"],
      "resourceDomains": ["https://persistent.oaistatic.com"],
      "frameDomains": ["https://*.example-embed.com"]
    }
  }
}
```

- `connectDomains` – hosts your widget can fetch from.
- `resourceDomains` – hosts for static assets like images, fonts, and scripts.
- `frameDomains` – optional; hosts your widget may embed as iframes. Widgets without `frameDomains` cannot render subframes.

If you want to use `window.openai.openExternal(...)` without seeing a safe-link
warning, use the field `redirect_domains` under `openai/widgetCSP`.

Caution: Using `frameDomains` is discouraged and should only be done when embedding iframes is core to your experience (for example, a code editor or notebook environment). Apps that declare `frameDomains` are subject to higher scrutiny at review time and are likely to be rejected or held back from broad distribution.

### Widget domains

Set `_meta.ui.domain` on the widget resource template (the `registerAppResource`
template). This is required for app submission and must be unique per app.
ChatGPT renders the widget under `<domain>.web-sandbox.oaiusercontent.com`, which
also enables the fullscreen punch-out button.

```json
"_meta": {
  "ui": {
    "csp": {
      "connectDomains": ["https://api.example.com"],
      "resourceDomains": ["https://persistent.oaistatic.com"]
    },
    "domain": "https://myapp.example.com"
  }
}
```

### Component descriptions

**ChatGPT extension (optional):** Set `_meta["openai/widgetDescription"]` on the
widget resource to let the widget describe itself, reducing redundant text
beneath the widget.

```json
"_meta": {
  "ui": {
    "csp": {
      "connectDomains": ["https://api.example.com"],
      "resourceDomains": ["https://persistent.oaistatic.com"]
    },
    "domain": "https://myapp.example.com"
  },
  "openai/widgetDescription": "Shows an interactive zoo directory rendered by get_zoo_animals."
}
```

### Localized content

ChatGPT sends the requested locale in `_meta["openai/locale"]` (with `_meta["webplus/i18n"]` as a legacy key) in the client request. Use RFC 4647 matching to select the closest supported locale, echo it back in your responses, and format numbers/dates accordingly.

### Client context hints

ChatGPT may also send hints in the client request metadata like `_meta["openai/userAgent"]` and `_meta["openai/userLocation"]`. These can be helpful for tailoring analytics or formatting, but **never** rely on them for authorization. Treat `_meta["openai/userAgent"]` as optional, best-effort metadata, not as a stable way to detect which host surface is calling your server.

Once your templates, tools, and widget runtime are wired up, the fastest way to refine your app is to use ChatGPT itself: call your tools in a real conversation, watch your logs, and debug the widget with browser devtools. When everything looks good, put your MCP server behind HTTPS and your app is ready for users.

## Company knowledge compatibility

[Company knowledge in ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/introducing-company-knowledge/) (Business, Enterprise, and Edu) can call any **read-only** tool in your app. It biases toward `search`/`fetch`, and only apps that implement the `search` and `fetch` tool input signatures are included as company knowledge sources. These are the same tool shapes required for connectors and deep research (see the [MCP docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp)).

In practice, you should:

- Implement [search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp#search-tool) and [fetch](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp#fetch-tool) input schemas exactly to the MCP schema. Company knowledge compatibility checks the input parameters only.
- Mark other read-only tools with `readOnlyHint: true` so ChatGPT can safely call them.

To opt in, implement `search` and `fetch` using the MCP schema. For citations, set `url` to an absolute, user-openable HTTP or HTTPS URL for the cited resource. Keep provider-internal document identifiers and opaque lookup keys in `id`, not `url`. If no user-openable URL exists, leave `url` empty; ChatGPT keeps the result as ordinary tool output instead of creating a citation. For eligibility, admin enablement, and availability details, see [Company knowledge in ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12628342/) and the MCP tool schema in [Building MCP servers](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp).

While compatibility checks focus on the input schema, you should still return the recommended result shapes for [search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp#search-tool) and [fetch](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp#fetch-tool) so ChatGPT can cite sources reliably. The `text` fields are JSON-encoded strings in your tool response.

**Search result shape (tool payload before MCP wrapping):**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "doc-1",
      "title": "Human-readable title",
      "url": "https://example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

Fields:

- `results` - array of search results.
- `results[].id` - unique ID for the document or item.
- `results[].title` - human-readable title.
- `results[].url` - absolute, user-openable HTTP or HTTPS URL for citation.

In MCP, return this JSON as `structuredContent` and include the same value as a
JSON string in `content` for compatibility:

**Search tool response wrapper:**

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "results": [
      {
        "id": "doc-1",
        "title": "Human-readable title",
        "url": "https://example.com"
      }
    ]
  },
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\"results\":[{\"id\":\"doc-1\",\"title\":\"Human-readable title\",\"url\":\"https://example.com\"}]}"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Fetch result shape (tool payload before MCP wrapping):**

```json
{
  "id": "doc-1",
  "title": "Human-readable title",
  "text": "Full text of the document",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "metadata": { "source": "optional key/value pairs" }
}
```

Fields:

- `id` - unique ID for the document or item.
- `title` - human-readable title.
- `text` - full text of the document or item.
- `url` - absolute, user-openable HTTP or HTTPS URL for citation.
- `metadata` - optional key/value pairs about the result.

For `fetch`, return the document JSON the same way:

**Fetch tool response wrapper:**

```json
{
  "structuredContent": {
    "id": "doc-1",
    "title": "Human-readable title",
    "text": "Full text of the document",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "metadata": { "source": "optional key/value pairs" }
  },
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\"id\":\"doc-1\",\"title\":\"Human-readable title\",\"text\":\"Full text of the document\",\"url\":\"https://example.com\",\"metadata\":{\"source\":\"optional key/value pairs\"}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

Here is a minimal TypeScript example showing the `search` and `fetch` tools:

```ts



const server = new McpServer({ name: "acme-knowledge", version: "1.0.0" });

const searchOutputSchema = {
  results: z.array(
    z.object({
      id: z.string(),
      title: z.string(),
      url: z.httpUrl().or(z.literal("")),
    })
  ),
};

const fetchOutputSchema = {
  id: z.string(),
  title: z.string(),
  text: z.string(),
  url: z.httpUrl().or(z.literal("")),
  metadata: z.record(z.string(), z.string()).optional(),
};

server.registerTool(
  "search",
  {
    title: "Search knowledge",
    inputSchema: { query: z.string() },
    outputSchema: searchOutputSchema,
    annotations: { readOnlyHint: true },
  },
  async ({ query }) => {
    const structuredContent = {
      results: [{ id: "doc-1", title: "Overview", url: "https://example.com" }],
    };

    return {
      structuredContent,
      content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(structuredContent) }],
    };
  }
);

server.registerTool(
  "fetch",
  {
    title: "Fetch document",
    inputSchema: { id: z.string() },
    outputSchema: fetchOutputSchema,
    annotations: { readOnlyHint: true },
  },
  async ({ id }) => {
    const structuredContent = {
      id,
      title: "Overview",
      text: "Full text...",
      url: "https://example.com",
      metadata: { source: "acme" },
    };

    return {
      structuredContent,
      content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(structuredContent) }],
    };
  }
);
```

## Security reminders

- Treat `structuredContent`, `content`, `_meta`, and widget state as user-visible—never embed API keys, tokens, or secrets.
- Do not rely on `_meta["openai/userAgent"]`, `_meta["openai/locale"]`, or other hints for authorization; enforce auth inside your MCP server and backing APIs.
- Avoid exposing admin-only or destructive tools unless the server verifies the caller’s identity and intent.
