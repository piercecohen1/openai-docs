# Product Feed Spec

## Feed Reference

To make your products discoverable inside ChatGPT, merchants provide a
structured product feed file that OpenAI ingests and indexes. This
specification defines the product schema for file uploads: field names, data
types, constraints, and example values needed for accurate discovery, pricing,
availability, and seller context.

Each table below groups fields by schema object and indicates whether a field
is Required or Optional, along with validation rules to help your engineering
team build and maintain a compliant upload file.

Supplying all required fields ensures your products can be displayed correctly,
while optional fields enrich relevance and user trust.
